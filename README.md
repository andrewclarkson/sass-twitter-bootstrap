This is Not the Repo You're Looking For
---------------------------------------

This is a **Bare Bones** fork of the Twitter Bootstrap styles (made by the authors below) ported to Sass (by the developers below)

Up until now I've cloned the entire repo everytime I wanted some sweet Twitter Bootstrap scss in my project.

Now I clone *just the Sass*.

Tiny repo, to fix a tiny quibble.

Check out the *Real* (Sass Twitter Bootstrap)[https://github.com/jlong/sass-twitter-bootstrap]

And the original (Twittter Bootstrap)[https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap]
